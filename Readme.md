# BeatSaviorUI

This is a fork of the Beat Saber plugin BeatSaviorData, which shows various data about your plays in the level results screen. Unlike BeatSaviorData, this does not collect or upload any data externally and is purely about showing more information about your play results.

## Manual Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In addition to BSIPA, you must have [SiraUtil](https://github.com/Auros/SiraUtil) and [BeatSaberMarkupLanguage](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage) installed for this mod to load. Install them using your mod manager i.e. [BSManager](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#bsmanager).

Place the contents of the unzipped folder from the latest [release](https://github.com/qqrz997/BeatSaviorUI/releases/latest) into your Beat Saber installation folder. If you need more information regarding manual installation of mods [this wiki page](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#manual-installation) will help. For further help with installing mods, join the [Beat Saber Modding Group](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) discord server.

Older versions of BeatSaviorUI are not supported. If you find issues using an older version then I won't be able to help.
